============

Function Identification for science olympics.

Written in 2012 by Michael Harwood for the London, Ontario, Science Olympics, hosted by University of Western Ontario.

It was written when Java applets were still a thing, so the code is setup that it can run as either an applet or a standalone application. It will work in both cases.

If you can't compile this, remove the "package sciOlympics;" from the first line of each of the 5 java files.
